They always have a great time, and [instructors] always go the extra mile to help my son, Taylor, so he can get the most out of the program. Also, when I was having a financially difficult time last year, [Justin] gave us a big discount, telling me that it was their passion to help out the community. I'm happy to say that I no longer need the financial assistance for the program, but it was so meaningful to feel that someone in the community cared about my kids' well-being and opportunities to experience wholesome activities.",
