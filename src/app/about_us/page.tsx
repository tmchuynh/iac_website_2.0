              leadership, tireless dedication, and profound impact on students,

                The journey of the International Activities Club (IAC) is deeply
                rooted in Justin's unwavering passion and heartfelt commitment
                to education. Before founding IAC, Justin established himself as
                an extraordinary educator, widely recognized for his dedication
                and transformative teaching approach. His exceptional abilities
                earned him recognition in the Tustin Weekly newspaper, where he
                described chess as not merely a game but a profound educational
                tool, cultivating essential life skills, strategic thinking, and
                personal growth.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8 text-base/7">
                Inspired by these meaningful experiences, Justin envisioned an
                inclusive educational community that transcends traditional
                methods. His dream was to create a nurturing environment where
                education goes beyond textbooks, fostering holistic, immersive
                learning experiences. Justin imagined a safe and welcoming space
                where students could freely explore their interests,
                authentically express themselves, and flourish both academically
                and personally. Central to this vision was a compassionate team
                of mentors and educators dedicated to guiding, supporting, and
                inspiring students, fostering intellectual curiosity, emotional
                resilience, and social growth.

              What began as Justin’s ambitious dream has become a continually
              expanding vision—one that seeks to reach more students, enrich
              educational offerings, and deepen the program’s lasting impact.
              His leadership is a constant reminder that education is more than
              the transfer of knowledge; it is the nurturing of both mind and
              heart. It is about preparing young people not just to succeed, but
              to do so with courage, compassion, and creativity. At IAC,
              education is a labor of love. Every lesson taught, every
              connection made, and every challenge overcome is rooted in a deep
              commitment to empowering students to dream boldly, reach
              confidently, and create a brighter, more inclusive future.
              Inspired by Justin’s unwavering dedication and compassionate
              vision, we strive each day to create a learning environment where
              every child feels valued, inspired, and equipped to thrive.
